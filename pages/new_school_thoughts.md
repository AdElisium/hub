# Thoughts on new schooling methods

## Opinions

#### 1

18 years + 4-5 years receiving education seems quite inefficient. Everything else in the world is becoming more and more optimised through engineering. How can we engineer a new school to be more optimised than it currently is?

#### 2

Things should be tought as the history of it. This way you understand where it comes from, the context of its creation and why it was created in the first place. This also helps keep a narrative that makes it easier to continue (advance through research) once the whole story has been learnt. Random topics out of context don't help build a true understanding of the entire field. An example of this is how Math is taught.

#### 3

Employees want people who have work experience, because the practicalities are learnt through work experience and not academia. Learning the theory is good but not useful unless you can put it in practice. At the same time, it is known that humans learn best through practice and repetition. For this reason, students should learn through experience, not theory. I believe it's faster and more effective, therefore I believe it's more efficient. At the same time, if this practice and experience is done correctly, this could mean that the student is practically working (work experience), therefore this practice can be monetised to receive incomes or reduce school fees.

#### 4

Current schools teach nothing about the economy, self-finance, tax, business, how to be and philosophy to live your life, how to setup a business, how to sell, etc.


#### 5

A skill that society can really benefit from is to be able to learn faster. If we can generate a society where we learn faster as a whole, Society will truly transform.

#### 6

What makes a school scalable? Video & tech. 
A second school could easily be created using the same software and videos anywhere else.

#### 7

In society you provide your community with something and get money as a reward. People are rewarded for their contributions to the world. That is how capitalism works. However, if education is one of the largest contributions one can give to society, why isn't it one of the largest rewarding businesses to run? There **must** be a way to absorb the money that corresponds to it.

#### 8

With the internet we now live in a world drowned in data. As individuals it's no longer about accessibility to information but about filtering information. With education it is necessary to rethink what information from everything we are being taught is valuable and filter to be able to learn what is truly valuable. 

#### 9

Must start with kids that are good with math. Can't address all areas of education in one go, only the one I'm familiar with. What % of kids with perfect math grades end up choosing a Natural Sciences (Physics, Math, Chemistry, Engineering...) path in GCSE, A-Level and Uni.

#### 10

We have applied efficiency to all aspects of our lives and improved them. However, efficiency has never been considered in education.

#### 11

When you learn to play the piano, you learn to play different music pieces one at a time. Once you've mastered one, you move on to the next. It doesn't make sense to have the student move on to the next more complicated piece if they've only managed to play half of the current one. In education getting a 5 is enough to move to the next, but ideally you don't learn new concepts until you have 100% learnt the current concepts.

#### 12

If education is treated as a business, which it is, how can a <10% client satisfaction of your service be acceptable to all of the schools? Most kids hate the experience and with all the homework their lives a miserable. Nobody is solving this problem. Clients/students must be VERY satisfied with the experience for it to be considered good.

## Ideas

* CoRT course from Edward de Bono
* Teach kids how to trade to increase revenue.
* Have the older students teach the younger ones to reduce expenses.
* kids apply what is learnt to generate an income, used to reduce fees. 
The essential idea is that the school self-sustains in some way (like the seminaire in Benin).
* Teach patience and ability to think long-term. Specially money-wise.
* Learn through videos to increase student bandwidth of each teacher. 
Kids all watch videos at their own pace. Students ask questions to one of the teachers in the room. The same teacher can work across all levels. Learning speed adjusts to each student and how fast they watch the videos. Exams are tailor-made to each student and the level that they are on. Exams are done at different moments in time for each student.

Having students learn at their own pace makes a sense of competition arise naturally, as students who are falling behind feel compelled to work harder. This creates an atmosphere where students are driven by each other to work hard.

* All students are required to wear screen-protecting glasses when sitting in front of a computer. Those who already wear glasses can use a cover that hangs on the glasses and acts as a bluelight filter.


## What is the objective of sending kids to school? What is it that we're trying to achieve?

## What should a school be like?

The intention here is to create expectations for what it should be like to then try and move the current education system into this new vision. What would one think or expect a school to be like?

### Essentially, what is it that a school should teach?

* How to think

What does it mean to think? What types of thinking are there?

Reason
Creative thinking
Lateral thinking

* How to be
* How to do

What you need, to be able to do (knowledge), and how to use it to do (application)

## Problems in schools

Too much emphasis is put on the individual in today's society. We need to go back to the classic notion of commune and cosmos where we are all part of a greater picture _together_.

# Random Notes

## Math Books
_Measurement_ - Paul Lockhart. Book about how math should be taught. The book is a powerful criticism on the prevalent curriculum of Mathematics in elementary, middle and high schools

## Data to gather

1. Student satisfaction across all ages with their previous year's education experience.

2. Out of the students that get 100% in Math at ages 5-8, how many of them go to Natural Science related degrees/lives.

6. Algebra in Persia
7. Mathematical notation in Reneissance

Modern Mathematics can be broadly split into 2 areas:
1. Pure Math: The study of Mathematics for its own sake.
2. Applied Math: When you develop math to solve a real-world problem.

### Pure Maths

####Number Systems
Study of numbers starts with natural numbers and basic arithmetic operations.

Then you can go through integers which contain negative numbers.

Rational numbers like fractions

Real numbers which include numbers like pi with infinite decimal points

Complex numbers

 Quaternion

 Octonion

 Cardinal numbers

 Interesting numbers like pi, e, prime numbers, infinity

####Structures

What you can do with these numbers and putting them into equations in the form of variables.

Algebra (equations) and rules on how to manipulate these equations.

vectors and matrices which are multidimensional numbers. And rules on how they relate to each other (linear algebra).

Number theory looks at all the other number systems mentioned before, like the properties of prime numbers.

Combinatorics: Properties of structures like trees & graphs and other things made of discrete chunks you can count.

Group Theory looks at objects related to each other in groups. Like permutation goups

Order theory investigates how to arrange objects following certain rules.

#### Spaces

Geometry

Trigonometry

Fractal Geometry - mathematical patterns which are scale invariant.

Topology - different properties of spaces that you can continuosly difform but not tear or glue them.

Measure theory - a way to assign values to spaces or sets, tying together numbers and spaces.

Differential geometry looks at properties of shapes on curved surfaces.

#### Changes

Calculus: integrals and differentials. Looks at areas of functions or behaviour of gradients of functions.

Vector calculus looks at same thing but for vectors

Dynamical systems - systems that evolve in time from one state to another. Like fluid flows or things with feedback like ecosystems.

Chaos theory - dynamical systems that are very sensitive to initial conditions.


Complex analysis - properties of functions with complex numbers


### Applied mathematics

Maths used in all the natural sciences

Mathematical Physics - uses just about everything mentiones in pure maths. Mathematical and theoretical physics have a close relationship with pure maths.

Mathematical Chemistry - modelling molecules

BioMathematics - evolutionary biology

Engineering - building things uses a lot of maths. Complex electrical systems that use control theory.

Numerical Analysis - used where maths becomes to complex to solve completely. Instead we use simple approximations and combine them together to get good approximate answers. In the real world numerical analysis is done on huge computers.

Game Theory - What the best choices are given a set of rules and rational players. Used in economics when the players can be clever but not always; and areas like psychology and biology.

Probability - Study of random events like coin tosses or dice or humans. Statistics is the study of random collections of random processes and analysis of data. Used in mathematical Finance for example.

Optimisation - calculate the best choice amongst the set of many different options or constraints. Usually visualised as maximum/minimum of a function.

Computer Science. Deeply related to pure mathematics. Rules are derived in pure maths.

Machine Learning creates intelligent computer systems. Uses linear algebra, optimisation, dynamical systems and probability.

Cryptography - important to computation. Uses combinatorics and number theory.

### Foundations of mathematics.

Tries to work out the properties of mathematics itself. What the basis of all the rules of maths is. Is there a complete set of fundamental rules called axioms which all the maths comes from? and can we proof that it is all consistent with itself?

 Mathematical logic along with Set theory and category theory try to answer this\

Mathematical logic - a famous result is Godel's incompleteness theorems. These theorems imply that it is all made up by us humans.

Theory of computation - different models of computing and how efficient they are at solving problems. Containc complexity theory with looks at what is and isn't computable and how much time and memory you need to do something, which for most interesting problems is an insane amount.
