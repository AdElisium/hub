Modern Mathematics can be broadly split into 2 areas:
1. Pure Math: The study of Mathematics for its own sake.
2. Applied Math: When you develop math to solve a real-world problem.

### Pure Maths

####Number Systems
Study of numbers starts with natural numbers and basic arithmetic operations.

Then you can go through integers which contain negative numbers.

Rational numbers like fractions

Real numbers which include numbers like pi with infinite decimal points

Complex numbers

 Quaternion

 Octonion

 Cardinal numbers

 Interesting numbers like pi, e, prime numbers, infinity

####Structures

What you can do with these numbers and putting them into equations in the form of variables.

Algebra (equations) and rules on how to manipulate these equations.

vectors and matrices which are multidimensional numbers. And rules on how they relate to each other (linear algebra).

Number theory looks at all the other number systems mentioned before, like the properties of prime numbers.

Combinatorics: Properties of structures like trees & graphs and other things made of discrete chunks you can count.

Group Theory looks at objects related to each other in groups. Like permutation goups

Order theory investigates how to arrange objects following certain rules.

#### Spaces

Geometry

Trigonometry

Fractal Geometry - mathematical patterns which are scale invariant.

Topology - different properties of spaces that you can continuosly difform but not tear or glue them.

Measure theory - a way to assign values to spaces or sets, tying together numbers and spaces.

Differential geometry looks at properties of shapes on curved surfaces.

#### Changes

Calculus: integrals and differentials. Looks at areas of functions or behaviour of gradients of functions.

Vector calculus looks at same thing but for vectors

Dynamical systems - systems that evolve in time from one state to another. Like fluid flows or things with feedback like ecosystems.

Chaos theory - dynamical systems that are very sensitive to initial conditions.


Complex analysis - properties of functions with complex numbers


### Applied mathematics

Maths used in all the natural sciences

Mathematical Physics - uses just about everything mentiones in pure maths. Mathematical and theoretical physics have a close relationship with pure maths.

Mathematical Chemistry - modelling molecules

BioMathematics - evolutionary biology

Engineering - building things uses a lot of maths. Complex electrical systems that use control theory.

Numerical Analysis - used where maths becomes to complex to solve completely. Instead we use simple approximations and combine them together to get good approximate answers. In the real world numerical analysis is done on huge computers.

Game Theory - What the best choices are given a set of rules and rational players. Used in economics when the players can be clever but not always; and areas like psychology and biology.

Probability - Study of random events like coin tosses or dice or humans. Statistics is the study of random collections of random processes and analysis of data. Used in mathematical Finance for example.

Optimisation - calculate the best choice amongst the set of many different options or constraints. Usually visualised as maximum/minimum of a function.

Computer Science. Deeply related to pure mathematics. Rules are derived in pure maths.

Machine Learning creates intelligent computer systems. Uses linear algebra, optimisation, dynamical systems and probability.

Cryptography - important to computation. Uses combinatorics and number theory.

### Foundations of mathematics.

Tries to work out the properties of mathematics itself. What the basis of all the rules of maths is. Is there a complete set of fundamental rules called axioms which all the maths comes from? and can we proof that it is all consistent with itself?

 Mathematical logic along with Set theory and category theory try to answer this\

Mathematical logic - a famous result is Godel's incompleteness theorems. These theorems imply that it is all made up by us humans.

Theory of computation - different models of computing and how efficient they are at solving problems. Containc complexity theory with looks at what is and isn't computable and how much time and memory you need to do something, which for most interesting problems is an insane amount.
