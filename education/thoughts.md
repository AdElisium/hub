Random thoughts. 

---

Too much emphasis is put on the individual in today's society. We need to go back to the classic notion of commune and cosmos where we are all part of a greater picture __together__.

---

18 years + 4-5 years receiving education seems quite inefficient. Everything else in the world is becoming more and more optimised through engineering. How can we engineer a new school to be more optimised than it currently is?

---

Things should be tought as the history of it. This way you understand where it comes from, the context of its creation and why it was created in the first place. This also helps keep a narrative that makes it easier to continue (advance through research) once the whole story has been learnt. Random topics out of context don't help build a true understanding of the entire field. An example of this is how Math is taught.

Employees want people who have work experience, because the practicalities are learnt through work experience and not academia. Learning the theory is good but not useful unless you can put it in practice. At the same time, it is known that humans learn best through practice and repetition. For this reason, students should learn through experience, not theory. I believe it's faster and more effective, therefore I believe it's more efficient. At the same time, if this practice and experience is done correctly, this could mean that the student is practically working (work experience), therefore this practice can be monetised to receive incomes or reduce school fees.

Current schools teach nothing about the economy, self-finance, tax, business, how to be and philosophy to live your life, how to setup a business, how to sell, etc.

A skill that society can really benefit from is to be able to learn faster. If we can generate a society where we learn faster as a whole, Society will truly transform.

What makes a school scalable? Video & tech. 
A second school could easily be created using the same software and videos anywhere else.

---

In society you provide your community with something and get money as a reward. People are rewarded for their contributions to the world. That is how capitalism works. However, if education is one of the largest contributions one can give to society, why isn't it one of the largest rewarding businesses to run? There **must** be a way to absorb the money that corresponds to it.

With the internet we now live in a world drowned in data. As individuals it's no longer about accessibility to information but about filtering information. With education it is necessary to rethink what information from everything we are being taught is valuable and filter to be able to learn what is truly valuable. 

---

Must start with kids that are good with math. Can't address all areas of education in one go, only the one I'm familiar with. What % of kids with perfect math grades end up choosing a Natural Sciences (Physics, Math, Chemistry, Engineering...) path in GCSE, A-Level and Uni.

We have applied efficiency to all aspects of our lives and improved them. However, efficiency has never been considered in education.

---

When you learn to play the piano, you learn to play different music pieces one at a time. Once you've mastered one, you move on to the next. It doesn't make sense to have the student move on to the next more complicated piece if they've only managed to play half of the current one. In education getting a 5 is enough to move to the next, but ideally you don't learn new concepts until you have 100% learnt the current concepts.

---

If education is treated as a business, which it is, how can a <10% client satisfaction of your service be acceptable to all of the schools? Most kids hate the experience and with all the homework their lives a miserable. Nobody is solving this problem. Clients/students must be VERY satisfied with the experience for it to be considered good.

In the dichotomy between learning through theory and learning through practice, theory doesn't help with being able to apply the knowledge. And practice doesn't give an underlying understanding of how it works to be able to improve on current implementations.
A possible solution is to first learn through practice and then add the theory to gain expertise. Basically you improve your knowledge by adding theory to a pre-existing understanding of the practice.
