Random ideas for education systems.


* CoRT course from Edward de Bono
* Teach kids how to trade to increase revenue.
* Have the older students teach the younger ones to reduce expenses.
* kids apply what is learnt to generate an income, used to reduce fees. 
The essential idea is that the school self-sustains in some way (like the seminaire in Benin).
* Teach patience and ability to think long-term. Specially money-wise.
* Learn through videos to increase student bandwidth of each teacher. 
Kids all watch videos at their own pace. Students ask questions to one of the teachers in the room. The same teacher can work across all levels. Learning speed adjusts to each student and how fast they watch the videos. Exams are tailor-made to each student and the level that they are on. Exams are done at different moments in time for each student.
